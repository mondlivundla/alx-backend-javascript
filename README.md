# Backend JavaScript Project

This README provides an overview of the backend JavaScript project. It covers the project description, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

## Project Description

The backend JavaScript project is designed to handle server-side operations, implement APIs, and interact with databases or other external services. It provides the necessary functionality to support the frontend or client-side applications.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the backend development.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible web application framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- [Additional technologies or frameworks used, if applicable]
