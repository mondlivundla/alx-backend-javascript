# ES6 Promise

The ES6 Promise is a JavaScript feature that provides a way to handle asynchronous operations. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and maintainable manner, using a simple and consistent API. Promises are widely used in modern JavaScript development, especially when dealing with network requests, file operations, and other asynchronous tasks.

## What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, avoiding the pitfalls of callback-based approaches.

A Promise can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The initial state, when the asynchronous operation is still in progress.
- **Fulfilled**: The state when the asynchronous operation has completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
- **Rejected**: The state when the asynchronous operation has failed or encountered an error, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

## Creating a Promise

You can create a new Promise using the `Promise` constructor. The constructor takes a callback function that has two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. Inside the callback function, you perform the asynchronous operation and call either `resolve(value)` when the operation is successful or `reject(reason)` when it fails.

Here's an example of creating a simple Promise that resolves after a timeout:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Operation completed successfully!');
  }, 2000);
});
```

## Promise States

As mentioned earlier, a Promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Once a Promise settles in either the fulfilled or rejected state, it becomes immutable, meaning its state cannot change again.

To handle the result of a Promise, you can use the `then()` method, which takes two optional callback functions: `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`. The `onFulfilled` callback is called when the Promise is fulfilled, and the `onRejected` callback is called when the Promise is rejected.

```javascript
myPromise.then(
  (value) => {
    console.log(value); // Output: Operation completed successfully!
  },
  (reason) => {
    console.error(reason); // Output: Error occurred!
  }
);
```

## Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained together, allowing you to sequence multiple asynchronous operations. The `then()` method returns a new Promise, which can be used to handle the result of the previous Promise and perform further operations.

```javascript
myPromise
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // Output: Operation completed successfully!
    return 'Next operation';
  })
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // Output: Next operation
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.error(reason); // Output: Error occurred!
  });
```

## Handling Promise Errors

To handle errors in Promises, you can use the `catch()` method. It acts as a catch-all for any errors that occur in the Promise chain. If any Promise in the chain is rejected, the control jumps to the nearest `catch()` block.

```javascript
myPromise
